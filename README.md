# Trapezoid Canvas
A simple project to set up two trapezoids on a canvas to tessellate with each other and show a background.

## Goal
* Two shapes rendered next to each other with an appropriately scaled background
* Canvas can detect which shape the mouse is hovering over and then swap in a video
* Visuals scale appropriately to different screen sizes
* Animations and videos run smoothly with no performance hit to the machine
* Works in all modern browsers

## Thanks
All contributions welcome - thanks to all who have offered pointers so far.
